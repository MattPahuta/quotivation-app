### What I learned

This project, part of the Skillcrush React Hooks course, was an excellent opportunity to implement many foundational React concepts, including useState() and useEffect(), and utilize [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Additionally, the app makes use of modern JavaScript techniques such as filter(), find(), and local storage.

## Acknowledgments

This project is part of the [Skillcrush](https://www.skillcrush.com) React Hooks course and much of the foundational elements of the code, including base HTML, CSS styles, initial App.js state, and general design was provided as a boilerplate project. That said, all React/JavaScript code as well as much of the customized CSS was coded by myself, by hand, during and after the project walkthrough.
